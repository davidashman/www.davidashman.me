In an [interview with Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT0ytynSqg), an early innovator in AI, he gave a somewhat dystopian perspective on the pending joblessness that will come with more and more intelligent AIs.  His argument was that, unlike the industrialization and mechanization of assembly lines, when the automation allowed for more production of scarce goods and so more jobs were created to manufacture more stuff, cognitive work doesn't scale like that and when one person can do the thought work of 10, with AI assistance, nine people will lose their jobs.

Tim O'Reilly, founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media, stated in his article [The End of Programming As We Know It](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-end-of-programming-as-we-know-it/) that he believes the opposite - that with AI assistants, we will just create more interesting and more complicated software.  We will continue to need just as many, if not more, developers to handle the work.

Both bring interesting perspectivees and good evidence to support their beliefs.  I certainly don't see myself on the same level as Tim or Geoffrey, but I have a slightly more nuanced belief that is based on the simple principle that AI is just another tool.

One thing has remained consistent in software businesses in capitalist societies all along - every business has their own unique tolerance for profitability.  In the same industry, you will see one business that is funded in a way to expect significant losses for years and hire many more developers than another because they are focused on releasing **as much** product as possible in the shortest time possible.  The other company may favor profitability more and will restrain or even cut back on staffing to ensure profitability is sustained.

It's highly unusual that a company is so flush with staff that they don't have something in their backlog that they feel would be really great to have in production and that they could make more money if they did.  Typically, those backlogs are pretty long and there's never enough time or people to create everything they want to.  The introduction of AIs into the PDLC will act as a productivity multiplier and more of those backlog ideas will come to the front.  

I believe companies will need to find a new equilibrium with AI in the mix.  In some cases, businesses may fire some engineers, or more likely freeze additional hiring because they can do more with less.  Many businesses will leverage the productivity gains to create more product from their backlogs and potentially scale up to more staff because of the increased revenue.  Ultimately, I don't believe that AI will render all softwnare engineering moot and there will be no jobs (at least not for a long while).  I think it will change the economics that every company's CEO, CFO and CTO have to use to determine staffing levels.
