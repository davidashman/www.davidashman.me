    content: |-
      I began my career as a software engineer driven by a passion for building systems that solve real-world problems. Over the years, that passion evolved into a mission: to lead teams that create technology with purpose, scale, and impact.
      
      Starting in engineering roles and rising through the ranks, I have built a rewarding career helping early growth-stage companies mature their processes, technologies and team topologies to become more efficient and to deliver high-quality products more reliably.
      
      Though my focus is now on leading technology organizations, I remain highly technical and hands on.  Continuing to invest in my technical knowledge allows me to deliver a unique blend of techincal solutions and customer-focused outcomes.
